# Introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package

In this repo, you will find the slides of my introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package. The presentation is available [here](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/introspatialR/).

To reproduce the slides, you may clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley: 

The data are mostly big shapefiles that you can download directly from [here](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/4xknhWGhp2PqRsJ). Unzip the file, and put everything in a shp/ directory. 

The first version of the slides was released on Feb 8, 2019, then amended on Oct 30, 2020 (structuration in directories, cleaning, use of DT and mapview packages).
